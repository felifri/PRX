# PRX

Training framework for the PRX text-to-image diffusion models by [Photoroom](https://www.photoroom.com/).

Read the full story on the [Hugging Face blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/Photoroom/prx-open-source-t2i-model).

## Overview

PRX is a transformer-based latent diffusion model trained with flow matching. This repository contains everything needed to train and evaluate PRX models, including:

- A patchified transformer denoiser
- Support for multiple text encoders (T5, T5-Gemma2B, Qwen3) and VAEs (AutoencoderKL, DC-AE)
- Distributed training via [MosaicML Composer](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer) with FSDP
- Training algorithms: EMA, REPA/iREPA, SPRINT, TREAD, contrastive flow matching, Perceptual losses (P-DINO, LPIPS), etc.
- Evaluation metrics: FID, CMMD, DINO-MMD

## Pre-trained models

Pre-trained PRX models are available on Hugging Face and can be used directly with [diffusers](https://huggingface.co/Photoroom/prx-1024-t2i-beta).

## Installation

Requires Python 3.11+.

```bash
uv sync

# With optional dependencies
uv sync --extra streaming   # MosaicML Streaming dataset support
uv sync --extra lpips       # LPIPS perceptual loss
uv sync --all-extras        # Everything
```

## Training

Training is configured with [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) YAML files. See [`configs/yamls/`](configs/yamls/) for examples. The repository includes all the training configurations used in the benchmarks presented in the [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/Photoroom/prx-part2).

```bash
composer -m prx.training.train --config-path=configs/yamls hydra/launcher=basic
```

## Data
We will post tomorrow a script to convert datasets into the MDS format used by PRX and exemplify how to use it to train a model on a your dataset.
